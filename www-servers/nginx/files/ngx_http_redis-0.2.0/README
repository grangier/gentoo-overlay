nginx HTTP redis module
--

Description:
--

The nginx HTTP redis module for caching with redis,
http://code.google.com/p/redis/.

The redis protocol
(http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/ProtocolSpecification)
not yet fully implemented, but GET and SELECT commands only.



Installation:
--

You'll need to re-compile Nginx from source to include this module.
Modify your compile of Nginx by adding the following directive
(modified to suit your path of course):

./configure --add-module=/absolute/path/to/ngx_http_redis
make
make install



Usage:
--

http
{
 ...
        server {
                location / {
			set $redis_db   "0";
                        set $redis_key  "$uri?$args";
                        redis_pass      127.0.0.1:6379;
                        error_page      404 502 504 = @fallback;
                }

                location @fallback {
                        proxy_pass      backed;
                }
        }
}
